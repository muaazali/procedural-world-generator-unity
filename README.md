# Procedural Terrain Generator
This project aims to simplify the process of creating complex worlds by using terrain generation techniques. Generating the terrain through Perlin Noise is the technique opted for this particular project. More techniques might be explored later on.

## Samples
WIP; GIFs will be attached.

## Working
- A completely empty terrain is spawned in a Unity scene.
- The scripts of this project generate a Perlin Noise sample.
- A seed is chosen (by default; randomly) and that particular chunk of Perlin Noise is accessed.
- Depending on the seed, the terrain mesh is modified to conform with the data in the perlin noise.
- Parameters like height factor (controlled with a curve) and colors/textures in the terrain can be changed to fit your world the best.

## How to use it?
